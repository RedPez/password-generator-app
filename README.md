# password-generator-app

## Description

The challenge this week was to create a random password generator based on criteria that a user submits.

Here are the critical elements required to recieve full marks:

- Generate a password when the button is clicked
  - Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    - Length of password
      - At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    - Character types
      - Lowercase
      - Uppercase
      - Numeric
      - Special characters ($@%&\*, etc)
  - Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  - Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
